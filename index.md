# About Me

<img align="left" src="Portrait_Sq.png" alt="Cosplaying Steve Jobs" width="200" hspace="25" vspace="25"/> 
Originally from San Diego, California, I am a final-year Undergraduate student of Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh Scotland, after which I will begin studying towards my PhD at Stanford University. I am particularly interested in sociolinguistics and the linguistic creation of personae in popular music, as well as in morphology more generally.

I am currently serving as the President of the University of Edinburgh [Linguistics Society](eulingsoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk) for the 2019-2020 academic year, as well as the National Chair of the Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain [(ULAB)](https://www.ulab.org.uk/)

When I'm not doing linguistics, I can often be found reading (especially horror), playing video games, or spending time with my friends. I'm always down for a good coffee-and-books session!
