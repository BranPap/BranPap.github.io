# Brandon Papineau (BranPap) - He/Him

## About Me

<img align="right" src="Portrait_Sq.png" alt="Cosplaying Steve Jobs" width="200" hspace="25" vspace="25"/>
Originally from San Diego, California, I am a final-year undergraduate student of Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh Scotland. After the completion of my undergraduate degree, I will begin studying towards my PhD at Stanford University.

I am currently serving as the President of the University of Edinburgh [Linguistics Society](https://eulingsoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk/) for the 2019-2020 academic year, as well as the National Chair of the Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain [(ULAB)](https://www.ulab.org.uk/) for the 2019-2020 academic year.

When I'm not doing linguistics, I can often be found reading (especially horror), playing video games, or visting the theatre. I'm always down for a good coffee-and-books session!

My friends in California call me BranPap and you're welcome to, too!

## Research

I am particularly interested in sociolinguistics morphology. Within sociolinguistics, I work on the linguistic construction of personae in popular music and on heritage language maintenance and how we conceptualise heritage speakers. With regard to Morphology, I am interested in conversion (zero-derivation) as a derivational process, especially in the case of syntactic phrase conversion (e.g. 'we were [Jack and Rose]-ing on the side of the ship').
