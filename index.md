My name is Brandon Papineau. I am a final-year Undergraduate student of Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh Scotland, after which I will begin studying towards my PhD at Stanford University. 

On this site, you can find my publications, as well as learn more about me.

A personal favourite quote from Warren Maguire:
