    I am a final-year undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh, where I have recently submitted my dissertation: 
     <em>Reconceptualising the Heritage Speaker: Toward a Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional, and Emic Profile of Heritage Speakers. 
         A case study of Spanish in San Diego, California.</em>) I am currently serving as the National Chair of the 
     Undergraduate Linguistics Association of Britain</p>
     <p> In the autumn, I will begin studying towards a PhD student at Stanford University. I hope to focus my research on 
         sociolinguistics and the linguistic constructions of personae in contemporary popular music. I also hope to expand
     into the study of linguistic perception of singing, focusing on misheard lyrics and how our social perceptions of musical
     artsists condition what we mishear.</p>
